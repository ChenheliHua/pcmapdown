      <h3>What is the Peace Corps Mapdown?</h3>
      <ul>
	<li>The Peace Corps Mapdown is a fun competition to show pride for your country of service and raise awareness of the latest digital mapping tools.</li>
	<li>Mapping is completed in a simple, open source, digital mapping website called <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=5/51.500/-0.100">OpenStreetMap</a>.</li>
	<li>Winners will be decided by amount of data input by team members, accuracy of the mapping, and the largest teams.</li>
	<li>Remember this is a competition. Recruit as many RPCVs, PCVs and friends to your team as possible. Anyone can participate in person or virtually.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Participating is easy and anyone can do it.</h3>
      <ul>
	<li>No experience with mapping needed since the main activity will be tracing satellite imagery. Check out this video to see how easy it has become.</li>
      </ul>
